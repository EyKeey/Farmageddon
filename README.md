# Farmageddon (Prototype)

Farmageddon is a resource management game inspired by Farm Frenzy, using next-generation mobile game elements.


The game has a level system. At each level, resource management becomes a little more difficult and the level completion goals are always changing. The aim is to keep the player's interest in the game.

Unlike Farm Frenzy, there is a merge system instead of production buildings. This gives you the freedom to increase the variety of items that can be added in the future.

Items produced can be sold. The player is constantly faced with the decision of whether to combine, sell or accumulate items, and can complete the level in any way they choose.
